So, now the interesting part:
How do you get your own lojten.mim file and how do you install it?

Simply run gen-table.bash from the project's main directory!
You should now see a lojten.mim file.
Then copy that file to /usr/share/m17n/ or /usr/local/share/m17n and when 
you 
restart SCIM, you should see the t-lojten listed as an input method.

(you have to install and configure SCIM and m17n of course)

Have fun!
